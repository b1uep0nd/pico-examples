= Attaching an RFID-RC522 RFID reader/writer via SPI

This example code shows how to interface the Raspberry Pi Pico W to an RFID-RC522 RFID reader/writer module via SPI at 3.3v.

This example implements basic RFID card detection and reading functionality. It can detect MIFARE cards and read their UID (Unique Identifier).

== Wiring information

Wiring up the device requires 7 connections as follows:

   * GPIO 4  -> MISO on RC522 board
   * GPIO 5  -> SDA/NSS (Chip select) on RC522 board
   * GPIO 6  -> SCK on RC522 board
   * GPIO 7  -> MOSI on RC522 board
   * GPIO 22 -> RST on RC522 board
   * 3.3V    -> 3.3V on RC522 board
   * GND     -> GND on RC522 board

The example here uses SPI port 0. Power is supplied from the 3.3V pin.

[NOTE]
======
Ensure the RC522 module is configured for 3.3V operation. Some modules have a jumper or switch to select between 3.3V and 5V operation.

== Usage

After building and uploading the example, the program will:
1. Initialize the RC522 module
2. Display the RC522 version register
3. Continuously scan for RFID cards
4. When a card is detected, display its UID

== Notes

This is a basic implementation. For more advanced features such as:
- Card authentication
- Reading/writing data blocks
- Different card types (ISO14443 Type A/B)

Refer to the RC522 datasheet and MIFARE specifications for detailed information.
